        <h1>Hi! Welcome to my website. where I will be talking about the basics of Web Designs</h1>
        <h2>
            <ol type="I">
                <li><u>What is Web Design? you may ask.</u></li>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./Images/104228210.png" width="500" alt="">

                                <h4>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content intended for the Internet. Modern web design goes beyond how things look (aesthetics) to
                                    include how things work (functionality). Web design is not limited to websites as it includes other uses such as web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.</h4>
                            </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <li>
                    <u>Here are some key components of web design:</u>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4>Layout: This is the way the graphics, ads, and text are arranged. In the web world, a key goal is to help the view find the information they seek at a glance. This includes
                            maintaining the balance, consistency, and integrity of the design.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Color: The choice of colors depends on the purpose and clientele; it could be simple black-and-white to multi-colored design, conveying the personality of a person or the brand of an organization, using web-safe colors</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Grapics: Graphics can include logos, photos, clipart, or icons, all of which enhance the web design. For user friendliness, these need to be placed appropriately, working with the color and content of the web page, while not making it too congested or slow to load.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Fonts: The use of various fonts can enhance a website design. Most web browsers can only read a select number of fonts, known as "web-safe fonts", so your designer will generally work within this widely accepted group.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Content:  Content and design can work together to enhance the message of the site through visuals and text. Written text should always be relevant and useful, so as not to confuse the reader and to give them what they want so they will remain on the site. Content should be optimized for search engines and be of a suitable length, incorporating relevant keywords.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>User Experience(UX): How a user interacts with a website can determine if they will take the action you want them to. A good web design is user-friendly, with a clear path for users to follow, and is accessible to as many users as possible.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>User Interface(UI):The user interface is the actual interface through which a user interacts with the website. This includes the screen, pages, buttons, and icons.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Navigation: Navigation is about how easy it is for people to take action and move around your website. Some tactics for effective navigation include a logical page hierarchy, using bread crumbs, designing clickable buttons, and following the 'three click rule' which means users will be able to find the information they are looking for within three clicks.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Multimedia: Relevant video and audio stimuli in the design can help users to grasp the information, developing understanding in an easy and quick manner. This can encourage visitors to spend more time on the webpage.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Compatibility: Design the webpage, so it performs equally well on different browsers and operating systems, to increase its viewing.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Technology: Advancements in technology give designers the freedom to add movement and innovation, allowing for web design that is always fresh, dynamic, and professional.</h4></li>
                        <li><h4>Interactive: Increase active user participation and involvement, by adding comment boxes and opinion polls in the design. Convert users from visitors to clients with email forms and newsletter sign-ups.</h4></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
